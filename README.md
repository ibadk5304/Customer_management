# Mern-Stack

## Description
This is a full-stack application using Mongo, express, React and NodeJS where user can register and login. I learn how to create rest API using mongodb, expressJS and NodeJS, also for the front end I used react where I dynamically showing the data. Further, used react routing for the protected route, higher order components to avoid repetition in code.
